Please make sure the 10x10 grid map represented in a text format suitable for parsing. Only provide the map in your response. Format the map as a table with 10 rows and 10 columns, where each cell contains a three-digit ObjectID of the tile or character which are provided in the environmentTiles and characters section. Separate each ID with a pipe '|' symbol and terminate each row with a newline character '\\n'. Include a colon at the end of the entire map. An example row might look like '001|002|003|...|010\\n', and there should be 10 such rows to complete the grid."
